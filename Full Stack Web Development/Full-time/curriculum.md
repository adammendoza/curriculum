# Array's Full Stack Web Development Course (Full-time)
In this 29-week course at [Array](http://www.arrayschool.com), students become junior-level developers by building web applications, developing their ideas into functional pieces of software, understanding collaborative web development workflows, and embarking on the career path of a web developer. This course will give aspiring web developers the confidence to build projects from start to finish at a professional level in a mobile-first world.

The focus of this course is learning to program in multiple languages to create web applications. The curriculum as a whole focuses on teaching students how to be professional full-stack developers capable of building scalable products with a team of developers. In addition to teaching Rails, this course also includes lessons on computer science, Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, CSS Pre-Processors, Command Line, Git, UI/UX design and principals, and database schemas.

## Approvals
Array, School of Technology and Design was incorporated by the State of Wyoming as Array, Inc., on April 19th, 2016.  Array currently has a private school license for Chapter 1 Non-Degree Granting Proprietary School by the Wyoming Department of Education. Array is not accredited and does not participate in federal or state financial aid programs. 

## Standards of Progress
At Array, we award students who have successfully completed our program with certificates. We award two types of certificates to our graduating students:

#### Grading System
Array, School of Technology and Design measures student progress through frequent homework assignments and in-depth projects. Students are graded on a pass/fail basis. To receive a passing grade, students must:

1. Receive a passing grade on 80% of all homework assignments. Homework is graded on the basis of completion. To receive a passing grade on a homework assignment, students must complete 100% of the minimum tasks specified in that assignment.
2. Maintain consistent attendance as outlined in our [Attendance section](http://arrayschool.com/downloads/Array_Catalog-Cheyenne2016.pdf). A passing grade in attendance will be given to students with no more than two or four absences, depending on the program.
3. Receive a passing grade on all course projects. Projects are graded on an A-F scale. A grade of a D and above is passing. 

Students are formally evaluated for progress towards completion at 12 weeks into their program.

Array does not have a cumulative final test or examination required for the completion of any of the courses. A statement will be furnished to students regarding satisfactory or unsatisfactory progress.

| Grade | Definition |
| :---  | :---: |
|**O** (Outstanding)| Has significantly exceeded all minimum course requirements with an acute eye for detail and standard of excellence. A grade of Outstanding is equivalent to an A+. |
|**P** (Pass)|Has satisfactorily met all minimum course requirements. A grade of Pass is equivalent to a grade of A-D.|
|**F** (Fail)|Has not satisfactorily met all minimum course requirements. A grade of Fail is equivalent to an F.|
|**I** (Incomplete)|An incomplete is only provided if a faculty member gives an extension to a particular student to complete a course project. An extension can be granted for a maximum of 30 days from the last day of class. If a student is not able to complete his/her project within this amount of time, he/she will be given an F.|

### Certificate of Completion
A Certificate of Completion is issued within seven days of the end of the course to each student who has successfully fulfilled the Array, School of Technology and Design requirements of obtaining a “Pass” in a course and has satisfactorily completed our curriculum and work ethic standards.
