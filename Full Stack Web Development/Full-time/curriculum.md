#### Grading System
Array, School of Technology and Design measures student progress through frequent homework assignments and in-depth projects. Students are graded on a pass/fail basis. To receive a passing grade, students must:

1. Receive a passing grade on 80% of all homework assignments. Homework is graded on the basis of completion. To receive a passing grade on a homework assignment, students must complete 100% of the minimum tasks specified in that assignment.
2. Maintain consistent attendance as outlined in our [Attendance section](http://arrayschool.com/downloads/Array_Catalog-Cheyenne2016.pdf). A passing grade in attendance will be given to students with no more than two or four absences, depending on the program.
3. Receive a passing grade on all course projects. Projects are graded on an A-F scale. A grade of a D and above is passing. 

Students are formally evaluated for progress towards completion at 12 weeks into their program.

Array does not have a cumulative final test or examination required for the completion of any of the courses. A statement will be furnished to students regarding satisfactory or unsatisfactory progress.
