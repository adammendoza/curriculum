# Full Stack Web Development (Full-time)
In this 24-week course at [Array](http://www.arrayschool.com), students become junior-level developers by building web applications, developing their own ideas into functional pieces of software, understanding collaborative web development workflows, and embarking on the career path of a web developer. This course will give aspiring web developers the confidence to build projects from start to finish at a professional level in a mobile-first world.

The focus of this course is learning to program in multiple languages to create web applications. The curriculum as a whole focuses on teaching students how to be professional full-stack developers capable of building scalable products with a team of developers. In addition to teaching Rails, this course also includes lessons on computer science, Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, CSS Pre-Processors, Command Line, Git, UI/UX design and principals, and database schemas.

## Approvals
Array, School of Technology and Design was incorporated by the State of Wyoming as Array, Inc., on April 19th, 2016.  Array currently has a private school license for Chapter 1 Non-Degree Granting Proprietary School by the Wyoming Department of Education. Array is not accredited and does not participate in federal or state financial aid programs. 

## Standards of Progress
At Array, we award students who have successfully completed our program with certificates. We award two types of certificates to our graduating students:

#### Grading System
Array, School of Technology and Design measures student progress through frequent homework assignments and in-depth projects. Students are graded on a pass/fail basis. To receive a passing grade, students must:

1. Receive a passing grade on 80% of all homework assignments. Homework is graded on the basis of completion. To receive a passing grade on a homework assignment, students must complete 100% of the minimum tasks specified in that assignment.
2. Maintain consistent attendance as outlined in our [Attendance section](http://arrayschool.com/downloads/Array_Catalog-Cheyenne2016.pdf). A passing grade in attendance will be given to students with no more than two or four absences, depending on the program.
3. Receive a passing grade on all course projects. Projects are graded on an A-F scale. A grade of a D and above is passing. 

Students are formally evaluated for progress towards completion at 12 weeks into their program.

Array does not have a cumulative final test or examination required for the completion of any of the courses. A statement will be furnished to students regarding satisfactory or unsatisfactory progress.

| Grade | Definition |
| :---  | :---: |
|**O** (Outstanding)| Has significantly exceeded all minimum course requirements with an acute eye for detail and standard of excellence. A grade of Outstanding is equivalent to an A+. |
|**P** (Pass)|Has satisfactorily met all minimum course requirements. A grade of Pass is equivalent to a grade of A-D.|
|**F** (Fail)|Has not satisfactorily met all minimum course requirements. A grade of Fail is equivalent to an F.|
|**I** (Incomplete)|An incomplete is provided only if a faculty member gives an extension to a particular student to complete a course project. An extension can only be granted for a maximum of 30 days from the last day of class. If a student is not able to complete his/her project within this amount of time, he/she will be given an F.|

### Certificate of Completion
A Certificate of Completion is issued within 7 days of the end of the course to each student who has successfully fulfilled the Array, School of Technology and Design requirements of obtaining a “Pass” in a course and has satisfactorily completed our curriculum and work ethic standards.
